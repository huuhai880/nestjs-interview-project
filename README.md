## 1. Getting started

### 1.1 Project configuration

Start by cloning this project on your workstation or click on ["Use this template"](https://github.com/new?template_name=nestjs-template&template_owner=Saluki) in Github.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/huuhai880/nestjs-interview-project
```

The next thing will be to install all the dependencies of the project.

```sh
cd ./my-project
cd /frontend
npm install

then

cd /backend
npm install

```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can now configure your project by creating a new `.env` file containing the environment variables used for development.

## 1.2 Default NPM commands

The NPM commands below are already included with this template and can be used to quickly run, build and test your project.

```sh
# Start the application using the transpiled NodeJS
npm run start

# Run the application using "ts-node"
npm run dev

# Transpile the TypeScript files
npm run build

# Run the project' functional tests
npm run test

# Lint the project files using TSLint
npm run lint
```
